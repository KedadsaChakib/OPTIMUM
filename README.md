# Algorithmic Simplification of Boolean Functions

## Overview
This project focuses on the optimization of logical functions through algorithmic simplification techniques, specifically targeting Boolean functions. The goal was to develop a web application capable of efficiently simplifying complex logical expressions using advanced algorithms.


### Key Features
- McCluskey and Petrick methods for algorithmic simplification of Boolean functions.
- Utilized heuristic API to improve computational efficiency and reduce complexity in logical operations for a large number of minterms.
